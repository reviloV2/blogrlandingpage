# blogrlandingpage

This is my solution to the Blogr Landing Page. 

This was my first full attempt at making a responsive full website layout with a collapsable navbar menu. 

I ran into a lot of issues while creating the javascript and responsiveness of the webpage as I am not very advanced with javascript and attempted to to the drop down 
menu using classList. This ran into an error as getElementByClassName will return a html collection and not the element and after hours I was not able to get this to work
with Id class or QuerySelectorAll. In the end i did this with Id and had to manually do this for each navbar item with different Ids which made everything look very messy. 

Also, I can not seem to make responsive websites as I encounter a lot of issues with media queries. Surely there must be an easier way to go about making responsive sites
other than re-coding the entire webpage to make this fit mobile. 

Any feedback is appreciated. 

Thanks!
